# Worker Playground
Rails app to test/integrate the [Gundog](http://github.com/alihuber/gundog) gem.  
All workers/specs should be pretty self-explanatory.  
Remember, to run the specs you need an RabbitMQ-Server set up, Gundog configured and started via the `rails gundog:run RAILS_ENV='test'` rake task.
